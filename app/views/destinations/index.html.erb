<!-- I don't know CSS well but if we put a div here could we have a link
at the top of the page that says "most popular," which just directs the screen to the div. 

It became clear that if we only sorted the index by popularity, then if there is no itinerary linked to a destination, the destination won't show up. It makes the most sense
to have the sorted list either here or on it's own route. -->
